## Why are you interested in a career investment banking?

I'm interested in investment banking because I am fundamentally driven by solving strategic problems. While I have a technical background, my passion lies in applying that analytical rigor to the real-world challenges clients and the firm face. The process of analysis, building complex models, and working with a team to advise clients on decisions is incredibly interesting to me as I find it a good balance for client and data facing work.  At Collaborative Conveyancing I combined this analysis with LLM data pipelines and it helped support positioning, and similarly at DeepLearnHS I translated highly technical AI concepts into an investor-facing demo. I want to bring that analytical and client-communication skillset into banking, where delivering solutions under time pressure makes a impact. 

With this passion, I've actively sought out experiences that mirror the work of an analyst, like building a DCF model in a Forage simulation. I was faced with conflicting data between management and consensus estimates, and I had to pressure-test assumptions and build a scenario analysis to get to a defensible valuation. It was that process of deep fundamental analysis and structured problem-solving that confirmed my passion for this work. I don't just enjoy the analysis; I thrive on the challenge of synthesizing conflicting information to provide clear, strategic advice for clients.

That's the same discipline I want to bring to advising clients at investment banking at BlackRock.

I am pursuing investment banking because it is the ultimate career for solving high-stakes, strategic problems with rigorous analysis. My technical projects are exercises in **deep fundamental analysis and meticulous financial modeling**—requiring me to stress-test assumptions until I have a robust, accurate result. This directly mirrors the IBD process of **valuation and due diligence**.

I've proactively validated this interest through practical application. For example, while building a DCF model in a Forage simulation, I was faced with conflicting data between bullish management projections and conservative equity research. To resolve this, I **pressure-tested the assumptions**, benchmarked them against peers, and built a **scenario-based valuation** to provide a clear risk-reward analysis for a potential investor. This process of turning complex, conflicting information into a strategic advisory tool is what excites me most about banking.

My experiences at DeepLearnHS and Collaborative Conveyancy—**translating technical complexity into clear value for clients**—confirmed that my skills are best applied in a client-facing, advisory role. Investment banking is where I can merge this analytical depth with strategic thinking to deliver tangible impact for clients.

## Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly.

During my internship at Collaborative Conveyancing, I was asked to support an LLM project by designing Python pipelines for legal email data. At the time, I had limited experience with NLP. I quickly researched preprocessing techniques, built regex-driven cleaning functions, and adapted them for large-scale datasets of over 10,000 emails. Within weeks, I had a working pipeline that improved data quality for client demos. This showed me how I can pick up new concepts rapidly and apply them in a practical, results-focused way.

## Describe a time you worked with people from different backgrounds.

At DeepLearnHS, I collaborated with both AI engineers and non-technical stakeholders. The engineers built complex models, while investors wanted a clear narrative of how the product worked. I acted as the bridge, creating an animation that translated technical mechanics into an intuitive demo. By listening to each group’s priorities and using both technical and creative skills, I delivered something that satisfied both audiences and directly supported the Series A fundraising.

## Tell me about a mistake you made and what you learned.

Early in my equities forecasting project, I focused too much on maximising raw model accuracy without fully accounting for trading costs and realistic constraints. The backtests looked impressive, but when I factored in transaction costs, the strategy underperformed. I corrected this by redesigning the evaluation framework with rolling-window splits and more robust metrics like Sharpe ratio. It taught me the importance of practicality and attention to detail — a mindset I’d bring to banking, where clients expect accurate and realistic analysis under pressure.

## What skills have you developed outside of academics that will help you in banking?

Leading the Reading School Computing Society as Computer Science Prefect taught me how to manage a group, organise initiatives, and motivate people with different interests. Similarly, managing the backend team on the Running App project gave me practical experience with Agile sprints and deadlines. These experiences sharpened my ability to manage workload, lead others, and stay focused on delivery — skills directly relevant to working in high-pressure banking environments.

## What do you think are the biggest challenges facing investment banks today?

One challenge is navigating technological disruption — from AI in risk management to fintech competition in capital markets. Banks must integrate technology to remain efficient while managing the regulatory and reputational risks of doing so. Another challenge is the interest rate environment, which directly impacts deal flow, valuations, and client appetite for financing. Having followed both AI-driven fintech projects and market sentiment-based research myself, I see how innovation and macroeconomic forces are reshaping the industry simultaneously.

## How do you handle receiving feedback or criticism?

In my first internship, I presented an early draft of my data cleaning pipeline. My supervisor pointed out that my regex rules were too narrowly designed and might miss edge cases. Instead of being defensive, I took the feedback on board, broadened the logic, and documented my methods more carefully. The result was a much more robust pipeline. I’ve learned to see feedback as a way to improve quickly — a mindset I’ll carry into banking, where expectations are high and precision matters.

## Tell me about yourself?

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Bath, fundamentally driven by solving complex, high-stakes problems with rigorous analysis—which is why I'm passionately pursuing a career in investment banking.

My projects, like building a transformer-based forecasting model, are exercises in  analysis and financial modelling, requiring me to test assumptions and iterate until I have a robust, accurate result. This directly mirrors the IB process of valuation and due diligence.

In my internships, I focused on the client-facing application of this skillset. At DeepLearnHS, I translated the technical AI models into  narratives for Series A investors, which is similar to conveying complex financial data into an equity story. I'm now seeking to apply this combination of analytical depth and client-oriented communication at the highest level.

## Why do you wanna join BlackRock

I particularly want to join BlackRock due to the firm's constant pushing for performance and results in a team environment while most importantly building trust and having solid and strong relationships with clients. Another principle I have taken a key eye to is the emotional ownership of the company as for me someone who enjoys integrating ML and data driven insights, accepting responsibility of of the failure of things and with that comes a refined and better performances levels. With regards to performance I like the idea of the relentless want for innovation and more as this really reflects how I go about my projects, constantly refining and iterative till i get repeatable and good results. 

This was reinforced during my experience in the Amplifyme Finance Accelerator, where strong risk management and fundamental analysis were critical to performance. The prospect of working at a firm that champions this same discipline while building trusted, long-term client relationships is what excites me most about the opportunity at BlackRock.

The integration of Aladdin’s analytics with the strategic advisory work of the investment banking team is great. From my research on the platform, i can tell its ideal place to apply my skills in data-driven analysis not just to theoretical models, but to providing strategic advice for clients.

## Describe a condition where you encounter conflicting data or information. 

While building a discounted cash flow model to value a company for a Forage simulation, I encountered conflicting data between the company EBITDA projections and more conservative estimates from research reports.

My process was to try and act as an analyst would. First, I tested the company's assumptions by benchmarking them against historical performance and peer growth rates.

To resolve the conflict, I made the **data-driven decision** to create a bunch of scenarios which provided a more comprehensive valuation range, highlighting the potential upside while clearly quantifying the risks for a potential investor.

This experience taught me how to navigate conflicting information not by seeking a single answer, but by building a framework that allows for informed decision-making under uncertainty—which is the essence of strategic advisory in IB.

## Recent market news and how that impacts the market and individual.

One of the most significant recent market developments is the announcement of new tariffs on  imports. This is a perfect example of how news directly drives market volatility.

The immediate impact is a classic of investors fearing about supply chains and higher costs of imported stuff and this causes sell-offs in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. For the individual investor, this creates uncertainty and often leads to reactive, emotionally-driven decisions—like selling on the headline—which can lock in losses.

For me this is why my work on the **Stock Sentiment Analyser** is relevant, it quantifies the market in a sense. Now For an investment banker advising a client, this is crucial. This sentiment can impact a client's valuation, or alter the strategic positioning for an acquisition. Understanding and anticipating these sentiment-driven swings allows a bank to provide more forward-looking advice, helping clients navigate volatility rather than just instinctively and emotionally react to it.

## Why do you wanna join J.P. Morgan?

I want to join J.P. Morgan because of the firm’s ability to combine rigorous research with innovation, while always putting client trust at the forefront. When I read your research paper on _Conservative Bias in Large Language Models_, I was struck by the focus on robustness and transparency in applying new technologies – values I share in my own work. For example, I led a team project building a FinBERT and LLM-based sentiment index, where ensuring interpretability and reproducibility was just as important as generating results.

What excites me most about J.P. Morgan is the opportunity to work within a research culture that mirrors this mindset: investigating new technologies, but always with the discipline of risk-awareness and client-first application. This approach also came through during my experience in the Amplify Finance Accelerator, where I ranked in the top 10 for returns while maintaining strong risk management. Joining J.P. Morgan would allow me to pair my technical skills in machine learning and optimisation with a culture of disciplined research and client trust – qualities I believe are vital to delivering actionable market insights.

## Why do you wanna join Bank of America?

I was drawn to Bank of America after attending the firm-wide virtual recruitment event, where the emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and building long-term client trust stood out to me. The Global Research division’s role in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights aligns strongly with my own academic and project experience. My work on a Transformer-based equity forecasting model and a quantum-enhanced portfolio optimiser reflects my passion for research-driven innovation, but also the discipline required to ensure robustness and reproducibility – values that mirror Bank of America’s approach.

I am particularly excited by how Bank of America uses research not only to understand markets but to support client decision-making in a transparent, trustworthy way. This reflects my own philosophy: that data and models only create value when they are communicated clearly and responsibly. Whether through my leadership of a FinBERT-powered sentiment index project or my performance in financial simulations where I ranked in the top 10, I’ve consistently paired innovation with risk management. I am eager to bring this same mindset to Bank of America’s research teams, contributing to insights that guide clients through dynamic and complex markets.
