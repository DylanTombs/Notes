## Why are you interested in a career investment banking?

I'm interested in investment banking because I am fundamentally driven by solving strategic problems. While I have a technical background, my passion lies in applying that analytical rigor to the real-world challenges clients and the firm face. The process of analysis, building complex models, and working with a team to advise clients on decisions is incredibly interesting to me as I find it a good balance for client and data facing work.  At Collaborative Conveyancing I combined this analysis with LLM data pipelines and it helped support positioning, and similarly at DeepLearnHS I translated highly technical AI concepts into an investor-facing demo. I want to bring that analytical and client-communication skillset into banking, where delivering solutions under time pressure makes a impact. 

With this passion, I've actively sought out experiences that mirror the work of an analyst, like building a DCF model in a Forage simulation. I was faced with conflicting data between management and consensus estimates, and I had to pressure-test assumptions and build a scenario analysis to get to a defensible valuation. It was that process of deep fundamental analysis and structured problem-solving that confirmed my passion for this work. I don't just enjoy the analysis; I thrive on the challenge of synthesizing conflicting information to provide clear, strategic advice for clients.

That's the same discipline I want to bring to advising clients at investment banking at BlackRock.

I am pursuing investment banking because it is the ultimate career for solving high-stakes, strategic problems with rigorous analysis. My technical projects are exercises in **deep fundamental analysis and meticulous financial modeling**—requiring me to stress-test assumptions until I have a robust, accurate result. This directly mirrors the IBD process of **valuation and due diligence**.

I've proactively validated this interest through practical application. For example, while building a DCF model in a Forage simulation, I was faced with conflicting data between bullish management projections and conservative equity research. To resolve this, I **pressure-tested the assumptions**, benchmarked them against peers, and built a **scenario-based valuation** to provide a clear risk-reward analysis for a potential investor. This process of turning complex, conflicting information into a strategic advisory tool is what excites me most about banking.

My experiences at DeepLearnHS and Collaborative Conveyancy—**translating technical complexity into clear value for clients**—confirmed that my skills are best applied in a client-facing, advisory role. Investment banking is where I can merge this analytical depth with strategic thinking to deliver tangible impact for clients.

### Why are you interested in Market Research?


What excites me about a career in **Global Research** is the role it plays in connecting data, markets, and decision-making. Research is at the heart of helping clients understand complex signals and turn them into actionable insights, and I’ve always been motivated by that challenge of making sense of this uncertainty within markets.

In my academic work, I’ve had the chance to explore research projects that mirror this. For example, I built a **quantum-enhanced portfolio optimiser** using a Variational Quantum Eigensolver to identify optimal asset allocations. A big part of the project was benchmarking it against classical methods, testing its robustness, and understanding not just when it works, but why. That experience taught me how to approach problems methodically, evaluate trade-offs, and deliver research that is transparent and reproducible — qualities that are just as important in financial research.

Beyond university, I reinforced this at **DeepLearnHS**, where I worked with AI engineers to translate a proprietary model into an investor-ready demo. That meant simplifying technical complexity without losing accuracy, ensuring the end result was not only correct but also clear and compelling to clients. To me, that’s exactly what great research does — it bridging the gap of technical complexity with clarity and trust.

So for me, **Global Research is the ideal fit** — it combines the analytical depth I enjoy with the responsibility of generating insights that clients can actually use to make decisions. It’s that intersection of innovation and impact that makes me excited to pursue this path with ___. 

## Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly.

During my internship at Collaborative Conveyancing, I was asked to support an LLM project by designing Python pipelines for legal email data. At the time, I had limited experience with NLP. I quickly researched preprocessing techniques, built regex-driven cleaning functions, and adapted them for large-scale datasets of over 10,000 emails. Within weeks, I had a working pipeline that improved data quality for client demos. This showed me how I can pick up new concepts rapidly and apply them in a practical, results-focused way.

## Describe a time you worked with people from different backgrounds.

At DeepLearnHS, I collaborated with both AI engineers and non-technical stakeholders. The engineers built complex models, while investors wanted a clear narrative of how the product worked. I acted as the bridge, creating an animation that translated technical mechanics into an intuitive demo. By listening to each group’s priorities and using both technical and creative skills, I delivered something that satisfied both audiences and directly supported the Series A fundraising.

## What skills have you developed outside of academics that will help you in banking?

Leading the Reading School Computing Society as Computer Science Prefect taught me how to manage a group, organise initiatives, and motivate people with different interests. Similarly, managing the backend team on the Running App project gave me practical experience with Agile sprints and deadlines. These experiences sharpened my ability to manage workload, lead others, and stay focused on delivery — skills directly relevant to working in high-pressure banking environments.

## What do you think are the biggest challenges facing investment banks today?

One challenge is navigating technological disruption — from AI in risk management to fintech competition in capital markets. Banks must integrate technology to remain efficient while managing the regulatory and reputational risks of doing so. Another challenge is the interest rate environment, which directly impacts deal flow, valuations, and client appetite for financing. Having followed both AI-driven fintech projects and market sentiment-based research myself, I see how innovation and macroeconomic forces are reshaping the industry simultaneously.

## How do you handle receiving feedback or criticism?

In my first internship, I presented an early draft of my data cleaning pipeline. My supervisor pointed out that my regex rules were too narrowly designed and might miss edge cases. Instead of being defensive, I took the feedback on board, broadened the logic, and documented my methods more carefully. The result was a much more robust pipeline. I’ve learned to see feedback as a way to improve quickly — a mindset I’ll carry into banking, where expectations are high and precision matters.

## Tell me about yourself?

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Bath, fundamentally driven by solving complex, high-stakes problems with rigorous analysis—which is why I'm passionately pursuing a career in investment banking.

My projects, like building a transformer-based forecasting model, are exercises in  analysis and financial modelling, requiring me to test assumptions and iterate until I have a robust, accurate result. This directly mirrors the IB process of valuation and due diligence.

In my internships, I focused on the client-facing application of this skillset. At DeepLearnHS, I translated the technical AI models into  narratives for Series A investors, which is similar to conveying complex financial data into an equity story. I'm now seeking to apply this combination of analytical depth and client-oriented communication at the highest level.

## Why do you wanna join BlackRock

I particularly want to join BlackRock due to the firm's constant pushing for performance and results in a team environment while most importantly building trust and having solid and strong relationships with clients. Another principle I have taken a key eye to is the emotional ownership of the company as for me someone who enjoys integrating ML and data driven insights, accepting responsibility of of the failure of things and with that comes a refined and better performances levels. With regards to performance I like the idea of the relentless want for innovation and more as this really reflects how I go about my projects, constantly refining and iterative till i get repeatable and good results. 

This was reinforced during my experience in the Amplifyme Finance Accelerator, where strong risk management and fundamental analysis were critical to performance. The prospect of working at a firm that champions this same discipline while building trusted, long-term client relationships is what excites me most about the opportunity at BlackRock.

The integration of Aladdin’s analytics with the strategic advisory work of the investment banking team is great. From my research on the platform, i can tell its ideal place to apply my skills in data-driven analysis not just to theoretical models, but to providing strategic advice for clients.

## Describe a condition where you encounter conflicting data or information. 

While building a discounted cash flow model to value a company for a Forage simulation, I encountered conflicting data between the company EBITDA projections and more conservative estimates from research reports.

My process was to try and act as an analyst would. First, I tested the company's assumptions by benchmarking them against historical performance and peer growth rates.

To resolve the conflict, I made the **data-driven decision** to create a bunch of scenarios which provided a more comprehensive valuation range, highlighting the potential upside while clearly quantifying the risks for a potential investor.

This experience taught me how to navigate conflicting information not by seeking a single answer, but by building a framework that allows for informed decision-making under uncertainty—which is the essence of strategic advisory in IB.

## Recent market news and how that impacts the market and individual.

One of the most significant recent market developments is the announcement of new tariffs on  imports. This is a perfect example of how news directly drives market volatility.

The immediate impact is a classic of investors fearing about supply chains and higher costs of imported stuff and this causes sell-offs in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. For the individual investor, this creates uncertainty and often leads to reactive, emotionally-driven decisions—like selling on the headline—which can lock in losses.

For me this is why my work on the **Stock Sentiment Analyser** is relevant, it quantifies the market in a sense. Now For an investment banker advising a client, this is crucial. This sentiment can impact a client's valuation, or alter the strategic positioning for an acquisition. Understanding and anticipating these sentiment-driven swings allows a bank to provide more forward-looking advice, helping clients navigate volatility rather than just instinctively and emotionally react to it.

## Why do you wanna join J.P. Morgan?

What excites me about J.P. Morgan is its ability to combine world-class research with innovation, with not only results but also the relationships and integrity behind them. The firm has a reputation for producing rigorous and forward-looking insights that clients genuinely rely on, and that’s something I deeply admire and look for in a firm. For example, I was particularly interested in your paper on _Conservative Bias in Large Language Models_. To me, this demonstrated not only technological expertise but also a commitment to transparency and trust in research – ensuring that when you innovate, you do so responsibly and understand the risks you are taking.

That really resonates with my own approach. In a recent project, I led a team building a FinBERT and LLM-based sentiment index, where ensuring interpretability and reproducibility was just as important as generating predictive power. What stood out to me is that J.P. Morgan takes the same view – that research has to be robust and explainable to deliver value.

Beyond research, what also makes J.P. Morgan stand out to me is the collaborative culture and global impact. From my perspective, this is a place where innovation doesn’t happen in isolation – it’s powered by teams, diverse perspectives, and the drive to solve client challenges. Having experienced this myself within the team project

That’s why I’m so motivated to join J.P. Morgan. It’s not just about the scale of the firm or its reputation, but the way it operates – balancing innovation with rigour, teamwork with individual accountability, and research with client trust. Those are the same values I hold, and they’re the qualities I’m eager to bring to J.P. Morgan’s research team.

## Why do you wanna join Bank of America?

I became particularly interested in Bank of America after attending the firm-wide virtual recruitment event. What stood out to me was the culture of collaboration and transparency, as well as the emphasis on building long-term client trust. To me, that combination is incredibly powerful – because it shows the firm values not only results but also the relationships and integrity behind them.

I admire how Bank of America’s Global Research division transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights that clients can rely on in volatile markets. That clarity is something I really value. In my own work, whether on a Transformer-based equity forecasting model or a quantum-enhanced portfolio optimiser, I’ve learned that research is only valuable if it’s reproducible, transparent, and ultimately understandable. That’s the philosophy I see mirrored in Bank of America’s research, and it’s why the opportunity excites me so much.

I was particularly impressed by the introduction of Bank of America’s Fast Convergence (FC) technology in volatility-controlled indices. Moving beyond traditional once-a-day rebalancing, it systematically rebalances every hour, providing faster and strong risk management for better long-term performance. To me, this reflects the kind of forward-looking research and engineering that sets the firm apart. For me its the way you are tackling problems not just conceptually, but with practical systems that improve both stability and client results. It’s the same spirit I strive for in my own projects, where model interpretability and risk-management are just as important as their predictive accuracy.

Ultimately, what makes Bank of America so appealing to me is its culture of responsibility – both in the way it serves clients and in how it encourages teams to work together. It’s a place where I can apply my technical background in machine learning and optimisation, but also where I know I’ll grow by learning from colleagues who are equally committed to excellence and collaboration. That combination makes Bank of America the perfect place for me to build my career.


## Why do you want to join William Blair?

What excites me about William Blair is the way the firm blends rigorous equity research with forward-looking insights that guide investors through cycles. A great example is Neal Dingmann’s recent work on the energy sector, where despite short-term commodity noise, the research highlights a likely cyclical bottom and an inflection point for investors. That balance between short-term data and long-term allocation strategy really resonated with me.

In my own experience, I’ve worked on projects that echo this approach. For example, in a Forage program I developed a machine learning model to predict seasonal swings in oil and gas, which required filtering out short-term volatility to extract meaningful patterns for allocation decisions. Similarly, my quantum-enhanced portfolio optimiser project was focused on asset allocation — benchmarking quantum against classical methods to see which allocations most efficiently balanced risk and return. Both experiences showed me how crucial allocation and timing are to performance, which aligns with William Blair’s philosophy.

That’s why I find William Blair’s research culture so appealing. It’s not just about tracking markets, but about making research actionable, client-relevant, and forward-looking. I’d be eager to contribute to that by bringing both my technical research background and my focus on  client impact.

## How do you handle situations where your initial approach doesn’t work?

I’ve learned to treat those situations as opportunities to refine my thinking. For instance, when I was developing a Transformer-based equity forecasting model, my first iterations were overfitting badly. It would perform extremely well on training data but fail to generalise. Instead of discarding the idea, I broke down the problem: I experimented with different regularisation techniques, reduced the parameter space, and re-framed the feature set around more meaningful financial indicators.

What started as a frustrating setback became one of the most valuable parts of the project. I ended up with a model that was not only more accurate but also interpretable, which for me was just as important.

That experience taught me two things. First, that persistence and iteration are crucial when working in complex systems. Second, that admitting that my approach wasn't working and systematically re-evaluating is far more productive than pushing forward blindly. Those are lessons I’d carry into research at J.P. Morgan, where rigour and adaptability are key to providing clients with reliable insights.

In the end, I see setbacks not as failures, but as checkpoints that refine my thinking — an approach I know is vital in research, where clients depend on us for solutions that are both innovative and dependable.

## Tell me about a time you worked in a team with different perspectives.

When I was leading the sentiment analysis project, our team of eight included people with very different backgrounds – some were more technical, some more finance-focused. At first, this created challenges: the technical members wanted to dive into modelling choices, while the finance students were more interested in how sentiment mapped to actual equity performance.

I realised that if we were going to succeed, I needed to create a common framework that tied the two together. So, I organised the workflow so that finance-focused members defined the key indicators and hypotheses, while the technical members built pipelines to test those hypotheses. That way, each group could play to its strengths, but we were always aligned on the same end goal.

The outcome was that not only did the project become more structured and effective, but people also felt their perspectives were respected and integrated. I think this mirrors the kind of collaboration needed in markets research at J.P. Morgan, where multiple disciplines intersect. For me, it was a great reminder that diverse perspectives, if managed well, create stronger results.

That experience showed me how powerful diverse perspectives can be when they’re channelled towards a shared goal — a mindset I’d bring to every collaboration at J.P. Morgan.

### What skills do you think are most important for success in this internship?

I think success in Markets Research comes down to three things: curiosity, discipline, and communication. Curiosity is definitely important. It drives me to look into datasets, question assumptions, and explore new methodologies — it has led me to build projects like a Transformer-based equity forecasting model and a quantum-enhanced optimiser. Discipline ensures the team and mine's results and output isn't just good but reproducible, risk-aware, and client-ready. These qualities I developed in simulations where I consistently ranked top 10 but the most important key to my success was balancing the returns with the risk management as these skills transfer directly to the internship and I will have to replicate. Communication and collaboration ties it together, because regardless of how strong the research or like result, clients need it presented clearly and with conviction in order to improve their trust in J.P. Morgans team which I think is definitely the most important metric for success. 

J.P. Morgan personally embodies this total blend. The culture of their innovative research combined with client-first transparency is exactly the environment where I want to apply my skills, and I believe those three traits will allow me to add real value to the team.

### Tell me about a time you had to communicate complex information to a non-technical audience.

During my internship at DeepLearnHS, I worked with AI engineers to take a proprietary deep learning model and turn it into an investor-ready animated demo. The model itself was highly technical, but our audience — investors — needed to understand its function, value, and reliability without diving into the backbone of the model. 

I focused on simplifying the language, breaking the system into managable chunks, and illustrating how the model’s performance compared to benchmarks. To reinforce credibility, I emphasised interpretability and practical outcomes. The demo was delivered ahead of schedule, and the feedback was that it gave investors both clarity and confidence.

That experience taught me that even the strongest analysis only creates value if people can act on it. For research at J.P. Morgan, the same principle applies: turning sophisticated modelling into clear, actionable insights that clients can trust.
