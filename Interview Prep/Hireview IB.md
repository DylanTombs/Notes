## Why are you interested in a career investment banking?

I’m motivated by the intellectual challenge and fast pace of investment banking. My background in computer science and mathematics has trained me to break down complex problems, and my internships have given me experience in both data-driven decision making and client-focused communication. At Collaborative Conveyancing I combined competitive analysis with LLM data pipelines to support strategic positioning, and at DeepLearnHS I translated highly technical AI concepts into an investor-facing demo. I want to bring that analytical and client-communication skillset into banking, where delivering precise solutions under time pressure makes a direct impact.

## What recent market development do you find interesting?

I’m following the role of AI in financial services. On one hand, firms are integrating AI to improve efficiency, from data pipelines to trading strategies. On the other, regulators are increasingly scrutinising AI’s use in risk management and client-facing contexts. This intersection of innovation and regulation creates both opportunities and challenges for investment banks, particularly in advising clients on technology-driven M&A and capital raising. Beyond projects and experiences, I keep a deep understanding of the markets through engagements of newsletters, like the Daily Peel and the Morning Brew. I've made it a part of my daily routine and allows me to keep my work recent and with the market. Additionally, these insights help contextualise my work, like my models, within broader macroeconomic trends.

## Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly.

During my internship at Collaborative Conveyancing, I was asked to support an LLM project by designing Python pipelines for legal email data. At the time, I had limited experience with NLP. I quickly researched preprocessing techniques, built regex-driven cleaning functions, and adapted them for large-scale datasets of over 10,000 emails. Within weeks, I had a working pipeline that improved data quality for client demos. This showed me how I can pick up new concepts rapidly and apply them in a practical, results-focused way.

## Describe a time you worked with people from different backgrounds.

At DeepLearnHS, I collaborated with both AI engineers and non-technical stakeholders. The engineers built complex models, while investors wanted a clear narrative of how the product worked. I acted as the bridge, creating an animation that translated technical mechanics into an intuitive demo. By listening to each group’s priorities and using both technical and creative skills, I delivered something that satisfied both audiences and directly supported the Series A fundraising.

## Tell me about a mistake you made and what you learned.

Early in my equities forecasting project, I focused too much on maximising raw model accuracy without fully accounting for trading costs and realistic constraints. The backtests looked impressive, but when I factored in transaction costs, the strategy underperformed. I corrected this by redesigning the evaluation framework with rolling-window splits and more robust metrics like Sharpe ratio. It taught me the importance of practicality and attention to detail — a mindset I’d bring to banking, where clients expect accurate and realistic analysis under pressure.

## What skills have you developed outside of academics that will help you in banking?

Leading the Reading School Computing Society as Computer Science Prefect taught me how to manage a group, organise initiatives, and motivate people with different interests. Similarly, managing the backend team on the Running App project gave me practical experience with Agile sprints and deadlines. These experiences sharpened my ability to manage workload, lead others, and stay focused on delivery — skills directly relevant to working in high-pressure banking environments.

## What do you think are the biggest challenges facing investment banks today?

One challenge is navigating technological disruption — from AI in risk management to fintech competition in capital markets. Banks must integrate technology to remain efficient while managing the regulatory and reputational risks of doing so. Another challenge is the interest rate environment, which directly impacts deal flow, valuations, and client appetite for financing. Having followed both AI-driven fintech projects and market sentiment-based research myself, I see how innovation and macroeconomic forces are reshaping the industry simultaneously.

## How do you handle receiving feedback or criticism?

In my first internship, I presented an early draft of my data cleaning pipeline. My supervisor pointed out that my regex rules were too narrowly designed and might miss edge cases. Instead of being defensive, I took the feedback on board, broadened the logic, and documented my methods more carefully. The result was a much more robust pipeline. I’ve learned to see feedback as a way to improve quickly — a mindset I’ll carry into banking, where expectations are high and precision matters.

## Tell me about yourself?


## Why do you wanna join BlackRock

"I particularly want to join BlackRock due to the firm's constant pushing for performance and results in a team environment while most importantly building trust and having solid and strong relationships with clients. Another principle I have taken a key eye to is the emotional ownership of the company as for me someone who enjoys integrating ML and data driven insights, accepting responsibility of of the failure of things and with that comes a refined and better performances levels. With regards to performance I like the idea of the relentless want for innovation and more as this really reflects how I go about my projects, constantly refining and iterative till i get repeatable and good results. 

## Describe a condition where you encounter conflicting data or information. 

## Recent market news and how that impacts the market and individual.

One of the most significant recent market developments is the announcement of new tariffs on Chinese imports. This is a perfect example of how news directly drives market volatility.

The immediate impact is a classic where investors anticipate fear about supply chains and higher costs of imported stuff and this causes sell-offs in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. For the individual investor, this creates uncertainty and often leads to reactive, emotionally-driven decisions—like selling on the headline—which can lock in losses.

This is precisely why my work on the **Stock Sentiment Analyser project** is so relevant. We're using LLMs and NLP to quantify market sentiment from news and social media. An event like this creates a massive, predictable sentiment shock which for me proves the market hole of **human reaction time.** An individual might read the news later or even act rash and emotionally. In contrast, a machine learning model, trained on historical data, can instantly read the headline, generate a probability, and execute a data-driven strategy just like that. 

This speed and objectivity in interpreting news is a modern source of alpha. It’s not just about having the information; it’s about processing it faster and more systematic.
