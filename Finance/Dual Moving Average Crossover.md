The Technical Approach suggests that when the Short Term Moving Average (STMA) moves above the LTMA, that represents a Buy (or Long) signal.  (Conversely, when the STMA moves below the LTMA, the Technical Approach indicates a Sell (or Short) signal.)  The intuition behind this strategy can be explained in terms of momentum.  Basically, the principle of momentum states that a price that is moving up (or down) during period t is likely to continue to move up (or down) in period t+1 unless evidence exists to the contrary.  When the STMA moves above the LTMA, this provides a lagged indicator that the price is moving upward relative to the historical price.  Buy high, sell higher.

## **Potential Issues**

There are portions of our analysis that must be analyzed to determine where there may be underlying hazards (i.e. risks) that may not be readily apparent:

1)      Data – Clean and unbiased data is vital to good analysis.  

2)      Risk – Besides taking a rather cursory look at the standard deviation of the expected return and the minimum total return.  Investors would also be interested in metrics such as maximum drawdown at any period in time.  (This information would also be relevant to the incentive structure for hedge fund managers.)  In sum, a more thorough examination of risks should be explored.  Perhaps this analysis could yield a “filter” approach to buy and sell signals.  As a result, we would not need to adopt an “always in (excluding weekends)” strategy.
