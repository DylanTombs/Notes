## 🟨 How to Think Like a Trader

- **Everything is about Supply & Demand**  
  → News changes how people feel about value → prices move.  
  → If many people want to buy: price ↑. If they panic and sell: price ↓.

- **You Don’t Need to Know Everything**  
  → Your job is to **react to information quickly** and **manage risk**.  
  → Focus on **probabilities**, not predictions.

- **Asset Prices Reflect Expectations**  
  → Prices move when *new info* breaks existing expectations.

## 🗞️ How to Interpret News in the Simulator

- **Positive News**:
  - Economic growth, good earnings → prices likely to go UP
  - For commodities: supply shortage → price ↑

- **Negative News**:
  - Interest rate hikes, inflation concerns, scandals → price ↓

- **Correlated Assets**:
  - If news says “Gold is up due to war concerns,” **expect oil to move too**.
  - Look for patterns like “risk-on” (stocks up, bonds down) or “risk-off” (stocks down, gold up).

---

## 🧮 Buy/Sell Decision Checklist

- 🔎 **Has news changed the value?**
- 📊 **Is the price reflecting that change yet?**
- 🕒 **Am I early enough to profit, or is it already priced in?**
- 📈 **Trend confirmation**: Is price moving in that direction?
- ⚖️ **What’s my risk if I’m wrong?**

---

## 🧷 Risk Management Tips

- Never go “all in” — keep buffer cash.
- Diversify if unsure — e.g., 2 long, 1 short.
- Don’t try to "win back" losses quickly — that’s gambling.
- Use “stop loss” logic in your head: cut bad trades early.

---

## 🧠 Mental Models

- **Second-Order Thinking**:  
  “If this news is good for oil, what will it do to airline stocks?”

- **Mean Reversion**:  
  Assets often return to a "fair value" after hype/panic.

- **Momentum**:  
  If price is moving fast after news, others might join → temporary trend.
