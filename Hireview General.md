Tell me about a time you led a team to achieve a goal.

I led an eight-person team on a fintech research project where we’re building a sentiment-based stock forecasting index using LLMs and financial APIs. I designed the Git workflow, allocated tasks, and created the model deployment roadmap. The challenge was aligning technical progress with research rigor, so I implemented reproducibility checks and set up data pipelines for 850,000+ labelled datapoints. By structuring the project clearly, we maintained momentum and are now on track to release a transparent, back-tested index that could serve as the foundation for trading strategy research.

Give an example of when you solved a difficult technical problem.

At DeepLearnHS, I was responsible for animating the mechanics of a proprietary AI engine for investor presentations. The renders were initially too slow for iteration. To fix this, I optimised the GPU pipeline using mesh decimation and baking, which cut per-frame render time by 60% and allowed us to deliver the final demo five days ahead of schedule. This experience showed me how technical optimisations can directly impact business outcomes — in this case, accelerating investor feedback during a critical fundraising process.

What is a recent market trend you find interesting?

I’m particularly interested in how sentiment is increasingly priced into markets. We’ve seen significant movements around earnings announcements or even social media sentiment, and funds are exploring ways to quantify and trade on this. That’s why I’m leading a project building a sentiment-based stock index: to explore how NLP pipelines and LLMs can process vast amounts of market chatter and potentially improve forecasting. I believe this is an area where quantitative approaches can add real value, particularly in short-term trading strategies.

Describe a project that demonstrates your ability to work with data.

During my data scientist internship at Collaborative Conveyancing, I designed Python pipelines to clean and format around 10,000 legal emails for LLM input. The challenge was the unstructured, noisy data. By applying regex and NLP pre-processing, I improved data quality, enabling the client-facing demos to run smoothly. This experience taught me how to balance technical rigour with business needs — in this case, producing a functional prototype to support leadership’s strategic positioning.

How do you prioritise tasks when working under pressure?

I break problems into smaller milestones and focus on bottlenecks first. For example, in my equities forecasting project, I faced the challenge of noisy time-series data across multiple assets. Instead of trying to optimise everything at once, I first stabilised the model by designing hybrid loss functions and then implemented Optuna for parameter tuning. By structuring tasks this way, I could deliver results at each stage while ensuring progress toward the larger goal.

## Why should we hire you over other candidates?

I combine strong quantitative and technical skills with demonstrated leadership and communication. I’ve built forecasting models with documented reproducibility, researched quantum-enhanced portfolio optimisation, and led teams to deliver research outputs. At the same time, I’ve had client-facing experience — translating AI models into an investor-ready demo and supporting strategy with competitive analysis. This mix of technical rigour, leadership, and business communication would allow me to contribute immediately, whether in quantitative research or investment banking.
