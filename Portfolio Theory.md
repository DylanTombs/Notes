## Concepts

- A portfolio = multiple assets, each with their own return and risk
- Diversification reduces overall portfolio risk
- Correlation between assets is key
- Leads to the concept of the Efficient Frontier

## Efficient Frontier

- Curve of optimal portfolios in risk-return space
- Below = inefficient
- Above = unattainable
- Investors want to hold portfolios **on the frontier**

## Capital Market Line (CML)

- Add a **risk-free asset** (e.g., treasury bond)
- Combines with risky portfolio → forms a straight line (CML)
- Slope = Sharpe Ratio
- Tangent point = Market Portfolio
