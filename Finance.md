**Signal Generation:**

A trade signal is a trigger for action, either to buy or sell a security or other asset, generated by analysis. That analysis can be human generated using technical indicators or it can be generated using mathematical algorithms based on market action, possibly in combination with other market factors such as economic indicators.

**Backtesting**:

Backtesting is a way of analysing the potential performance of a trading strategy by applying it to sets of real-world, historical data. The results of the test will help you lead with one strategy over another to get the best outcome

**Exponential Moving Average**:

The **EMA** is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new data than the **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**.

EMAtoday​=(Closing Pricetoday​×Multiplier)+(EMAyesterday​×(1−Multiplier))

- The first EMA value is just the SMA.
- After that, each new EMA is a weighted combination of the latest price and the previous EMA.

**Relative Strength Index**:

The **RSI** measures the speed and magnitude of price movements to identify **overbought (>70) or oversold (<30)** conditions.

RS = Avg Loss / Avg Gain​

Sharpe Ratio:

The **Sharpe Ratio** measures how much **excess return** you earn per unit of **risk** (volatility) you take
